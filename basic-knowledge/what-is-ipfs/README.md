# ðŸ•¸ What Is IPFS?

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), is a **protocol**, hypermedia, and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a **distributed** manner. It was founded by Juan Benet in 2014, in hopes of _**"preserve and grow humanity's knowledge**_\
_**by making the web upgradeable, resilient, and more open,".**_

**Notable Features:**

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Speed</strong></td><td>In contrast to the Hyptertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), IPFS allows the retrieval of files from <em>multiple nodes.</em></td><td>This leads to faster load times, not to mention substantial savings in bandwidth and cost-efficiency.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Security</strong></td><td>IPFS leverages cryptography and content-addressing to ensure content is unable to be tampered with. Once you upload a file, a fingerprint-liked CID will be generated for that particular file. Further, its decentralized nature means that hackers will not have a focal point of attack.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### **Who Needs IPFS?**

* **NFT projects:** For its distributed nature that ensures authenticity and immutability in NFT media
* **Creators:** For complete agency over their content and distribution methods
* **All of humanity:** _The average lifespan of a web page is 100 days._ The preservation of history and knowledge needs a more robust and immutable medium
