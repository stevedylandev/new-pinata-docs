# 1. Why NFTs Need IPFS

You may come across NFT assets that are hosted on platforms such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud, or even Dropbox. None of these solutions are well suited for something that you almost certainly want to prove the authenticity of. Think back to trading cards. Some of the rarest trading cards have an authority come in to verify their authenticity and provide certificates proving that authenticity. For digital items, this isn't possible.

At least, not by just looking at the digital asset. Instead, we can leverage [content addressability](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/) to prove the authenticity of a digital asset. When the asset is created, it can be added to the IPFS network. In doing so, a content identifier (CID) is generated. That identifier is unique to that asset. If someone had a copy of the assets and made a slight modification, the CID would change and anyone in the world would be able to see that the copy was not the original and thus (maybe) not as valuable.

We've covered this concept quite a few times, [but this post is a good place to start](https://medium.com/pinata/the-file-requirements-for-nfts-a20ea3ac524b) if you want to learn more.
