# 2. How To Upload Your NFT Media To Pinata

Before minting an NFT, you'll normally want to have the asset that will be associated with your token uploaded to IPFS. With Pinata, we make this easy.

Simply go to the Pin Manager, click the upload button, choose a file, and upload your file. When the upload is complete, you'll see your file in the grid and can copy the IPFS CID (the string of characters that starts with "Qm"). You'll need this CID later, so keep it handy. You can also come back to the Pin Manage page and copy it again at any time.
