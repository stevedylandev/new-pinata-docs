<summary>EVM Compatible</summary>

A blockchain or smart contract platform that is designed to replicate the functionality and behavior of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

This means that developers can write and deploy smart contracts using the same programming languages and tools as they would on the Ethereum network e.g. Solidity or Vyper.

_This also allows the seamless porting of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts between different platforms, enabling interoperability and fostering a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications._

_For an in-depth overview of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, refer to this_ [_documentation_](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)_, courtesy of the Ethereum Foundation._
