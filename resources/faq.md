## IPFS and Pinning

<details>

<summary>What does it mean to "pin" a file to IPFS?</summary>

Refer to [ipfs-pinning.md](../basic-knowledge/what-is-ipfs/ipfs-pinning.md "mention") to learn what pinning in the context of IPFS means.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are the files I store on Pinata private?</summary>

While Pinata doesn't share what's stored on our system with anybody, IPFS itself is a public network.

This means that any content added to the public IPFS network is discoverable by anybody using the network.

Fortunately, Pinata allows users to programmatically store their files as _private._ Our private file functionality gives you full control over who can access a file and when, without compromising on IPFS's content addressability.
