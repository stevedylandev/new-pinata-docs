To enable private file functionality, you will need to generate an API key.

When you click "New Key", a new key will be generated and the key can be copied from the table directly.&#x20;

Any key can have its access revoked by clicking the Revoke button. Once a key has been revoked, it can no longer be utilized for any purpose.
